## Resources for Statistical Rethinking, 2nd Edition

Statistical Rethinking is a course and textbook by Richard McElreath. The main materials for the course including lecture slides, lecture notes, homework exercises and solutions, and the accompanying R package `rethinking` are available from the main website: https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/

This repo provides additional resources to accompany the main materials. The resources are:

* `solutions_r`: Solutions to the Practice exercises at the end of each chapter of the book, written in R using `cmdstanr`, `data.table`, `bayesplot`, and `ggplot2`. Note that this is **not** a translation of the lecture notes / textbook or the homework exercises (you can find links to those on the main website).

See each subdirectory for further information and installation instructions.

### Contributing

Contributions, corrections, and discussion are more than welcome :) I'm using this course and textbook to learn more applied Bayesian stats, so I'm definitely not an expert and will probably make heaps of mistakes!
